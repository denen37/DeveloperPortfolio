                    The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to develop a
                    skill set that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young
                    minds
                    about how to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new
                    world of opportunities.

                    As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that is holding you back is yourself.

                    A quote I live perfectly by illustrates what I mean.

                    "How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't fail?"
                    You've already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's to
                    elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're <i>passionate</i>
                    about.

                    I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your company.
